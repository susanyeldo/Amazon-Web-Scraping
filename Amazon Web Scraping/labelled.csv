34,34,ansuman panda,"So when you buy the first apple iphone, after using samsung for quite a long time, the expectations are a bit on the higher side. But there are certain short comings. My brief idea after using an iPhone 13 for 1 month
Pros
1- the screen is amazing, no doubt about it. The pictures are crisp and viewing angles are good as well
2- the battery backup is good and if compared to a samsung s20+ it's ground breaking.
3- sound on this tiny bit of equipment is so loud and clear.
The bitter sweetness: the much touted camera is good but if compared to the same phone bought from a brick and mortar shop, the difference is staggering. The camera seems to be off and dull.
Cons: even the battery is small, the charging still takes a lot of time.",buy first apple iphone using samsung quite long time expectation bit higher side certain short coming brief idea using iphone 13 1 month pro 1 screen amazing doubt picture crisp viewing angle good well 2 battery backup good compared samsung s20 ground breaking 3 sound tiny bit equipment loud clear bitter sweetness much touted camera good compared phone bought brick mortar shop difference staggering camera seems dull con even battery small charging still take lot time,1

If you can spend more money and want a better camera go with Pro or ProMax
If you like the Apple EcoSystem you can get this else stick to Android

Pros :
1. Good Display / Brightness (Supports Dark mode and You can control White Tone which is nice). It has 60Hz refresh rate but you won't feel the difference imho
2. Good Battery Life (iPhone 13 Series has good battery life but ensure you have a supported charger) I use my MacBook's charger which charges the phone pretty quickly.
3. Best Privacy Control
4. Camera in Portrait Mode and Selfie Camera (LiveText Detection is a nice feature)
5. Fast Processor / RAM management is good
6. Great Resale value / Apple Support

Cons:

1. Screen size (6.1"" which is less in this price segment)
2. Optical Zoom in 13 is not great (If you want a camera phone go with Pro or Pro Max or Android alternative)
3. Third Party App Size is Huge (Gmail is 300MB / YouTube 250 MB). No native app lock option
4. Very Less OS customizations / No Fingerprint Scanner (hopeful this gets better with iOS 16)
5. No Native Support for mkv and other video formats (you can download a third party though)
6. Native iOS Apps either require a subscription or are paid.
7. File Management is restricted / Not easy to download *multiple* files from Telegram / Drive",tldr spend money want better camera go pro promax like apple ecosystem get else stick android pro 1 good display brightness support dark mode control white tone nice 60hz refresh rate wont feel difference imho 2 good battery life iphone 13 series good battery life ensure supported charger use macbooks charger charge phone pretty quickly 3 best privacy control 4 camera portrait mode selfie camera livetext detection nice feature 5 fast processor ram management good 6 great resale value apple support con 1 screen size 61 le price segment 2 optical zoom 13 great want camera phone go pro pro max android alternative 3 third party app size huge gmail 300mb youtube 250 mb native app lock option 4 le o customizations fingerprint scanner hopeful get better io 16 5 native support mkv video format download third party though 6 native io apps either require subscription paid 7 file management restricted easy download multiple file telegram drive,1

I have been a 4 year OnePlus flagship user, and I can say that there is absolutely no comparison. The software in iPhone works very well with the hardware. And it pairs up with my laptop like nothing I ever seen. I can copy on my phone and paste on my laptop and vice versa. I can pick up call on my laptop instead of phone while I am working. Can transfer files/images directly to my laptop from phone and vice versa without any loss in quality.

57,57,Amazon CUstomer,"This is my first IPhone
Phone looks and feels premium in hand, definitely you cannot compare with Chinese android phones.
Battery is sufficient for normal day to day use, if you use hotspot then it will be drained in 5 hours, I don�t play games so can�t comment.
Security, OS and hardware comprised intact kudos to apple for that, this is where iPhone stands out from other phones.
Volume and camera is amazing and you feel next level if you are switching from Chinese smart phones. Same Dolby and oled display feels premium in iphone.
Didn�t explore much on apple eco system, how ever I understood that you need to spend some extra bugs than usual if you want to be a premium user of apple eco system.
Nothing comes for free here, in fact you would loose the freedom of being an android user (less customisation and no side loaders)
In a good way, if you respect your privacy, security and getting premium services in the market you should choose iPhone.
New users are good to go for iPhone 13 with few extra grands with the current offers, you will get extra features that are missing in 12.
12 users forget about upgrading to 13 it will be a joke for you, it won�t worth it.",first iphone phone look feel premium hand definitely compare chinese android phone battery sufficient normal day day use use hotspot drained 5 hour dont play game cant comment security o hardware comprised intact kudos apple iphone stand phone volume camera amazing feel next level switching chinese smart phone dolby oled display feel premium iphone didnt explore much apple eco system ever understood need spend extra bug usual want premium user apple eco system nothing come free fact would loose freedom android user le customisation side loader good way respect privacy security getting premium service market choose iphone new user good go iphone 13 extra grand current offer get extra feature missing 12 12 user forget upgrading 13 joke wont worth,1
