0,Jamir,I�m not a phone fanatic but here is my simple and honest review.
1,Drieza,"Coming from android to iphone its just phenomenal. Its buttery smooth, no lag what soever, camera is top notch like its top quality."
2,RamLagan Yadav,iPhone 13 is very bad no response of company iam sad
3,vineet vs,"I took this phone in Feb , after using it for a month , it�s almost good but when it comes to camera , it�s bit worst compared to android , not up to the mark and even if u have full network u will not get a proper internet connection , every time the network gets up and down and literally u will get disappointed. Literally my decision from shifting android to iPhone was bit worse . I suggest to stick with android only ."
4,Vipul,Man undoubtedly most satisfying phone on the planet
5,krishna,Amazing Deal. ?????! ????? ??? ??? ???????????!
6,Amazon Customer,I�m writing this review after 2 months. If you�re planning to buy a iphone then purchase 13 not 14. Because there are no major upgrades or variations. If your old phone is iphone 11 then you can upgrade to 13 or 14.
7,Praveen,Awesome
8,Selva Bharathi,Superb
9,Aman Pratap,"Camera quality is good , front camera quality is very bad! battery life is very decent if you play games on it like Call of Duty it will not last long, but games runs so smoothly! Screen size is small, face id works perfect, No bugs! Display quality is best, All i want to say is spending this much money and getting least things is not worth, but its apple?? (we shell not talk about worth of money)"
10,Y.Sambasiva Rao,Super
11,Pallavi Meshram,"This is my first time using apple product and I am happy I switched from android to iPhone, worth the money. And I think there is no going back to android for me."
12,Ritesh Sejwal,Phone is ok but strongly say that I Phone company is a very Small Mind it to say because they have a Good quality phone but they do not have a Adeptor...!! Why customers going to another window or shop by another make it will be available on box with phone.

29,Shaik Inthiyaz ali,I got phone in just 8 hours gap. Loved the phone and delivery time
30,Sameer adhate,"Everything is good with this phone like camera(highly impressive video quality), battery life(normal use-more than 10hrs,Gaming-4-5hrs), performance(best). But con for me is it takes 1and half hour to charge(good factor-it takes 30mins for 50percent charge). Other than that a great phone for normal use and for gaming.writing this after 6months usage."
31,Manisha Pamnani,Good product with easy delivery
32,Rumpi Rockstar,The performance is amazing with a classic look. The screen size is perfect. Nice UI with a smooth performance.
33,Amazon Customer,Battery life not up to mark
34,ansuman panda,"So when you buy the first apple iphone, after using samsung for quite a long time, the expectations are a bit on the higher side. But there are certain short comings. My brief idea after using an iPhone 13 for 1 month
Pros
1- the screen is amazing, no doubt about it. The pictures are crisp and viewing angles are good as well
2- the battery backup is good and if compared to a samsung s20+ it's ground breaking.
3- sound on this tiny bit of equipment is so loud and clear.
The bitter sweetness: the much touted camera is good but if compared to the same phone bought from a brick and mortar shop, the difference is staggering. The camera seems to be off and dull.
Cons: even the battery is small, the charging still takes a lot of time."
35,Mar,A �more than capable� device smothered by a hefty price tag.
36,Suresh kumar,"The I phone 13 was very nice and I liked it ,I request to send an invoice of the product to my e mail"
37,Amazon Customer,Best
38,Amazon Customer,This is my first iPhone
39,Amazon Customer,"It�s only about only 2 months my charger cable not worming any more, what should indo"
40,Amazon Customer,No doubt over the performace and build quality.
41,Amazon Customer,Yes i love it??
42,Ajay,Quality over quantity. Loved it??
43,Amazon Customer,Full day with 100% Battery Camera quality was best
44,Amazon Customer,"This is the second time I am buying an iPhone from Amazon. Received the phone in good condition. Used for half an hour and the phone downloaded 15.4.1 update and started rebooting. But it never rebooted instead stuck in boot loop. I contacted Amazon they suggested to visit apple service Center. Apple products don�t come with replacement, if anything goes bad you have to visit apple care. I visited apple care which is at 70km from my place and they took my phone for service. After three days they provided a new iPhone with replacement letter containing old to new serial no and imei no. So everything ended happily. If your place is very far from apple care then you will be in trouble in such situations."
45,Amazon Customer,I like the colour
46,Amazon Customer,"worst packaging, Packaged iphone in plastic bag and shipped from Hariyana to Gujarat
overall Product is good"
47,Gaurav,"Good things
1. Camera as always amazing ( cinematic vedio is wow).
2. Battery performance has improved tremendously
3. No lags
4. Size is good , good for watching movies.
5. Look is above average.

Not good
1. Charger not available ( whatever logic company gives , it should be available, one have a buy ) , people buying iPhone can buy the charger additionally but that doesn't mean they will be excluded ??"
48,Sachin sharma,Overall a good quality product and best service from Amazon really appreciate
49,Saikumar,13??
50,SIMONKISKOO,First time upgraded to iphone nd it's worth it.??
51,Dr (Maj) Vishal Sahai,"LITTLE DOUBTFUL EARLIER SINCE IT IS FOR THE FIRST TIME I HAVE PURCHASE ANYTHING OF THIS HEFTY AMOUNT OF MONEY THROUGH AMAZON , BUT NOW 100% SATISFIED, I THANK AMAZON AND APPLE FOR KEEPING THIS CONFIDENCE AND TRUST....GOT BEST DEAL THRU AMAZON - IN MARKET IT IS APPROX 7000/- COSTLIER....ALSO RECEIVED INVOICE BILL AND PACKING SLIP ALONG WITH IT. NOW JUST WANTED TO VISIT APPLE SERVICE CENTER FOR FURTHER REGISTRATION AND WARRANTY CONFIRMATION."
52,Anil Sharma,"tl;dr:
If you can spend more money and want a better camera go with Pro or ProMax
If you like the Apple EcoSystem you can get this else stick to Android

Pros :
1. Good Display / Brightness (Supports Dark mode and You can control White Tone which is nice). It has 60Hz refresh rate but you won't feel the difference imho
2. Good Battery Life (iPhone 13 Series has good battery life but ensure you have a supported charger) I use my MacBook's charger which charges the phone pretty quickly.
3. Best Privacy Control
4. Camera in Portrait Mode and Selfie Camera (LiveText Detection is a nice feature)
5. Fast Processor / RAM management is good
6. Great Resale value / Apple Support

Cons:

1. Screen size (6.1"" which is less in this price segment)
2. Optical Zoom in 13 is not great (If you want a camera phone go with Pro or Pro Max or Android alternative)
3. Third Party App Size is Huge (Gmail is 300MB / YouTube 250 MB). No native app lock option
4. Very Less OS customizations / No Fingerprint Scanner (hopeful this gets better with iOS 16)
5. No Native Support for mkv and other video formats (you can download a third party though)
6. Native iOS Apps either require a subscription or are paid.
7. File Management is restricted / Not easy to download *multiple* files from Telegram / Drive"
53,VIKRAM BIHARI,"It�s first time that I purchased iPhone 13.No doubt it�s costly but a better quality of smartphone this is.I received iPhone in good condition ordered on Amazon after one day.phone is very good to hold ,to talk and it is not hitting as I felt almost all of smartphones of VIVO,Realme etc under Rs.20000/-overall it�s a good phone and I can purchase according to ur pocket size."
54,aambuj,"Gets all smartphone fundamentals right, jack of all trades, master of performance and battery life. I have been a 4 year OnePlus flagship user, and I can say that there is absolutely no comparison. The software in iPhone works very well with the hardware. And it pairs up with my laptop like nothing I ever seen. I can copy on my phone and paste on my laptop and vice versa. I can pick up call on my laptop instead of phone while I am working. Can transfer files/images directly to my laptop from phone and vice versa without any loss in quality. I am still exploring the benefits but so far now, it has been incredible."
55,Divyani,"Have been using iPhone 11,
Upgrade Feels worth it skipping iPhone 12

Very snappy and responsive

Camera improvement is evident

Os is smooth as always

No complaints whatsoever

Perfect product"
56,FARDANI,Well except that the product delivered was manufactured way back in April and the box looked old from outside. I didn't find anything negative. The phone works normal till date. Amazing camera. Loved how it syncs automatically with the iPad and how they work together to make my life tad a bit easier.
57,Amazon CUstomer,"This is my first IPhone
Phone looks and feels premium in hand, definitely you cannot compare with Chinese android phones.
Battery is sufficient for normal day to day use, if you use hotspot then it will be drained in 5 hours, I don�t play games so can�t comment.
Security, OS and hardware comprised intact kudos to apple for that, this is where iPhone stands out from other phones.
Volume and camera is amazing and you feel next level if you are switching from Chinese smart phones. Same Dolby and oled display feels premium in iphone.
Didn�t explore much on apple eco system, how ever I understood that you need to spend some extra bugs than usual if you want to be a premium user of apple eco system.
Nothing comes for free here, in fact you would loose the freedom of being an android user (less customisation and no side loaders)
In a good way, if you respect your privacy, security and getting premium services in the market you should choose iPhone.
New users are good to go for iPhone 13 with few extra grands with the current offers, you will get extra features that are missing in 12.
12 users forget about upgrading to 13 it will be a joke for you, it won�t worth it."
58,Amazon CUstomer,I don�t see 5G option under cellular mobile data
59,Amazon CUstomer,"THERE IS HEATING EFFECT WHICH CHARGING AND EVEN WHILE USING WITHIN A WEEKS TIME, WHICH USUALLY DOESNT HAPPEN WHEN PURCHASED FROM I-STORE, BUT PURCHASING IT ONLINE IS AN ISSUE."
60,Amazon CUstomer,"Amazing phone just missing some of the free twiks and apps which are available in android

Rest its a beast phone"
61,Amazon CUstomer,"Got delivery very quick within 48 hours and after using 1 day giving these reviews �.good and advanced phone , camera features has enhanced by apple as well as battery �.little bit heating problem I felt while using phone continuously�overall a good product to buy�"
62,Amazon CUstomer,Good
63,Amazon CUstomer,"Dislikes-
Switching from Android to iOS is a pain. We need to use paid apps to transfer chats which I didn't use.

Likes-
1. Best Camera for photos and videos.
2. Super battery life.
3. Face ID - It is even better now as it supports Face Masks.
4. Memory management - You don't have to kill apps in background. Keep them running as it improves battery life.
5. User experience - Animations and social apps integration are nice."
64,Amazon CUstomer,"Do not buy it if you have iPhone 12, there is no major difference. I�m little worried about battery life, it doesn�t look super promising."
65,Amazon CUstomer,"Don�t buy iphone in Amazon ,you will receive a non apple charger cable and it is very difficult to claim a warranty and icare Amazon will be playing blame game.
I have experienced myself a problem where charger cable wasn�t working and icare said that cable is non apple product."
66,Amazon CUstomer,Good
67,Amazon CUstomer,"Everything is good about this phone. The battery life is great. I get up to 8 hours of screen on time with heavy usage. The camera is great, nearly equivalent to dslr. Never slows down or doesn�t even look like it is 60Hz screen. But there is one thing that hurt me!?? No charger in box!?? this is criminal! ?? apple should give us a charger for free!"
68,Amazon CUstomer,"Delivered in time ! Was afraid of getting soap bars but got the real one luckily thanks amazon! Packaging could be better had a thought it wasn�t packaged safely.
Device:
1.Excellent camera
2.Updated ios
3.Speed is great
4.Flawless design
5. Battery oh my god apple nailed it you dont need to charge for the whole day believe me being a heavy user i can easily attain 8am-7pm
6.kudos to apple for this iphone 13."
71,Amazon CUstomer,There is a Light source flares on camera image when you direct your phone camera on light source. This is creating green light spot on image. It is problem with the iPhone lens. I don�t recommend this phone if you are a fan of camera. But you can use Snapseed app to remove it.
72,Amazon CUstomer,"I am android user. Converted to apple to show off(most will do). Now I used to it, display quality and touch feel awesome. This is my first flagship mobile. I hope i will use this phone for more years.

Yet still I don�t know much futures in my phone. If my other devices too apple products then would be great ecosystem"
73,Amazon CUstomer,"IPHONE 13 IS AWESOME CAMERA BEST EVERYTHING IS BEST
BUT PLZ REDUCED THE IPHONE 13 PRO MAX PRICE UPTO 50 PERCENT SO THAT EVERY SINGLE CAN AFFORD TO BUY.
I ALSO WANTED TO PURCHASE THAT BUT PRO HAVE SO HIGH INCREASED PRICE NO ONE CAN IMAGINE TO PURCHASE
THANK YOU ??????"
74,Amazon CUstomer,"Before time delivery and original product . Apple is beyond doubt the best phone maker have shifted from flagship samsung and liking the change . The fit n fineese of ghe product is amazing , battery backup is superb and airdrop is super fast like a blink . I short must go for iphn 13 pretty well balanced and hopefully will last for 5yrs as my ipad which is running solid since 2017. Make the shift from android as apple ios is buttery smooth."
75,Amazon CUstomer,Beast for a reason. There are some issues and limitations you fell when move from android apart from it it�s fine.
76,Amazon CUstomer,Wonderfully Phone with best battery life and face reading.
77,Amazon CUstomer,This iPhone was very cool. Am facing a little bit heat issues.although the performance is way too better than any other.
78,Amazon CUstomer,Battery backup is not good but recharge speed is very fast so you will hardly face battery issues. Camera quality is best.
79,Amazon CUstomer,"If you�re an android user and not sure whether to get an S series phone from samsung or an iphone, eyes closed choose apple.
IOS is stable and easy.
This iPhone is built like a beast,at any price less than 68k its a steal deal."
80,Amazon CUstomer,good
81,Amazon CUstomer,"I was not sure whether to buy from Amazon or not as I was more willing to buy it directly from Apple online store. But because of 11k discount, I ordered it from Amazon and the product received is good and I have verified the warranty on Apple website using serial number."
82,Amazon CUstomer,Battery life is one of best thing apple has done with this. I am using macbook from last one year and it has complete one day battery life and same thing i have found in iphone 13 as well. Camera quality is really nice.
83,Amazon CUstomer,I switche to oneplus 5 to iPhone 13 I really enjoyed photo Quality .but it's not be Friendly... like Android... still i was not Adjust IOS
84,Amazon CUstomer,Camera quality is too worst. Don't buy this if you want good photos. We can get this quality pictures with 5000 rupees android phone. I am totally disappointed because I expected range of iPhone camera quality but not this.. Waste of money. :-(
85,Amazon CUstomer,Trademark as all say!
86,Amazon CUstomer,"very nice.
over heating while charging"
87,Amazon CUstomer,"If you want to switch android to iOS, so take iPhone 13 and also carry your old android phone because face many problems in iPhones, not allowed double apps, Two physical sim,etc"
88,Amazon CUstomer,"Overall great experience except for the low refreshing rate.
Got the phone at 69,900.00 and unfortunately, the price decreased by 4000(Amazone Sale) after 1 day. Connected with the Amazon support team, they are unable to provide any discounts/offers on the product."
89,Amazon CUstomer,Very bad product..iPhone is a brand but it is only for iPhone itself..data browsing is very slow ..Ian using since last 1month the data browsing is very slow and Ian irritating to using mobile ..Ian searching any website it opens after 10 seconds..this is very bad and worst performance for iPhone
90,Amazon CUstomer,"Battery drains fast , I mean battery drains from 100% to 10% in just 3 hours , I can not believe this from apple. I exceeded my return policy dates so I can not return product."
91,Amazon CUstomer,Amazing experience and believe me by switching from android will give confidence in day to day life too.
92,Amazon CUstomer,I don�t know about others but I loved this phone. It�s really faster processor and upgraded camera sensors and lens. I have used Android and shifted back to Iphone13. Battery life simply superb. I highly recommend it if you are an iPhone lover. Sound quality is superior. Photo quality is the best. Screen is super bright.
93,Amazon CUstomer,Okayish camera
94,Amazon CUstomer,Good deal and a value for money product. Happy with the performance.
95,Amazon CUstomer,"This is first time i am using iPhone. Initial few days i was missing some feature of my old android phone but now i am loving the iPhone 13. Everything you hear on youtube about iPhone 13 is true, it�s a good phone buy it if you want it."
96,Amazon CUstomer,Phone�s a little heavy and rest of the things are good. Got it for a pretty good deal.
97,Amazon CUstomer,On a serious note I am in love with this phone it�s my first I phone and probably the best one out there ??Definitely worth the amount ..I got myself a midnight get yourself one too..
98,Amazon CUstomer,to know about the iPhone delivery by amazon. there was no issue with me. it was seal packed. also the iphone is original and running fine. discount offered was good.
