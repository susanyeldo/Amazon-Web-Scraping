0,Jamir,"            I took this phone in Feb ,  after using it for a month , it‚Äôs almost good but when it comes to camera , it‚Äôs bit worst compared to android , not up to the mark and even if u have full network u will not get a proper internet connection , every time the network gets up and down and literally u will get disappointed. Literally my decision from shifting android to iPhone was bit worse . I suggest to stick with android only ."

2,RamLagan Yadav,            I‚Äôm writing this review after 2 months. If you‚Äôre planning to buy a iphone then purchase 13 not 14. Because there are no major upgrades or variations. If your old phone is iphone 11 then you can upgrade to 13 or 14.Absolutely OS is awesome.Best battery life comapared to old versions. You can use 1full working day easily with 1time charge. If you‚Äôre a gamer then you have to charge evening.

4,vineet vs,"            Camera quality is good , front camera quality is very bad! battery life is very decent if you play games on it like Call of Duty it will not last long, but games runs so smoothly! Screen size is small, face id works perfect, No bugs! Display quality is best, All i want to say is spending this much money and getting least things is not worth, but its appleüòÇ (we shell not talk about worth of money)Edited review After using it 2 months -: battery life is good enough I charge it upto 90% and play on it with wifi and bluetooth connection on it reaches to 30% after 4 hours so battery is good enough‚Ä¶. And you will love how COD runs smoothly!! i love it..‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è worth of moneyü´°"
