0,Jamir,I’m not a phone fanatic but here is my simple and honest review.
1,Drieza,"Coming from android to iphone its just phenomenal. Its buttery smooth, no lag what soever, camera is top notch like its top quality."
2,RamLagan Yadav,iPhone 13 is very bad no response of company iam sad
3,vineet vs,"I took this phone in Feb , after using it for a month , it’s almost good but when it comes to camera , it’s bit worst compared to android , not up to the mark and even if u have full network u will not get a proper internet connection , every time the network gets up and down and literally u will get disappointed. Literally my decision from shifting android to iPhone was bit worse . I suggest to stick with android only ."
4,Vipul,Man undoubtedly most satisfying phone on the planet
5,krishna,Amazing Deal. ?????! ????? ??? ??? ???????????!
6,Amazon Customer,I’m writing this review after 2 months. If you’re planning to buy a iphone then purchase 13 not 14. Because there are no major upgrades or variations. If your old phone is iphone 11 then you can upgrade to 13 or 14.
7,Praveen,Awesome
8,Selva Bharathi,Superb
9,Aman Pratap,"Camera quality is good , front camera quality is very bad! battery life is very decent if you play games on it like Call of Duty it will not last long, but games runs so smoothly! Screen size is small, face id works perfect, No bugs! Display quality is best, All i want to say is spending this much money and getting least things is not worth, but its apple?? (we shell not talk about worth of money)"
10,Y.Sambasiva Rao,Super
11,Pallavi Meshram,"This is my first time using apple product and I am happy I switched from android to iPhone, worth the money. And I think there is no going back to android for me."
12,Ritesh Sejwal,Phone is ok but strongly say that I Phone company is a very Small Mind it to say because they have a Good quality phone but they do not have a Adeptor...!! Why customers going to another window or shop by another make it will be available on box with phone.

29,Shaik Inthiyaz ali,I got phone in just 8 hours gap. Loved the phone and delivery time
30,Sameer adhate,"Everything is good with this phone like camera(highly impressive video quality), battery life(normal use-more than 10hrs,Gaming-4-5hrs), performance(best). But con for me is it takes 1and half hour to charge(good factor-it takes 30mins for 50percent charge). Other than that a great phone for normal use and for gaming.writing this after 6months usage."
31,Manisha Pamnani,Good product with easy delivery
32,Rumpi Rockstar,The performance is amazing with a classic look. The screen size is perfect. Nice UI with a smooth performance.
33,Amazon Customer,Battery life not up to mark
34,ansuman panda,"So when you buy the first apple iphone, after using samsung for quite a long time, the expectations are a bit on the higher side. But there are certain short comings. My brief idea after using an iPhone 13 for 1 month
Pros
1- the screen is amazing, no doubt about it. The pictures are crisp and viewing angles are good as well
2- the battery backup is good and if compared to a samsung s20+ it's ground breaking.
3- sound on this tiny bit of equipment is so loud and clear.
The bitter sweetness: the much touted camera is good but if compared to the same phone bought from a brick and mortar shop, the difference is staggering. The camera seems to be off and dull.
Cons: even the battery is small, the charging still takes a lot of time."
35,Mar,A ‘more than capable’ device smothered by a hefty price tag.
36,Suresh kumar,"The I phone 13 was very nice and I liked it ,I request to send an invoice of the product to my e mail"
37,Amazon Customer,Best
38,Amazon Customer,This is my first iPhone
39,Amazon Customer,"It’s only about only 2 months my charger cable not worming any more, what should indo"
40,Amazon Customer,No doubt over the performace and build quality.
41,Amazon Customer,Yes i love it??
42,Ajay,Quality over quantity. Loved it??
43,Amazon Customer,Full day with 100% Battery Camera quality was best
44,Amazon Customer,"This is the second time I am buying an iPhone from Amazon. Received the phone in good condition. Used for half an hour and the phone downloaded 15.4.1 update and started rebooting. But it never rebooted instead stuck in boot loop. I contacted Amazon they suggested to visit apple service Center. Apple products don’t come with replacement, if anything goes bad you have to visit apple care. I visited apple care which is at 70km from my place and they took my phone for service. After three days they provided a new iPhone with replacement letter containing old to new serial no and imei no. So everything ended happily. If your place is very far from apple care then you will be in trouble in such situations."
45,Amazon Customer,I like the colour
46,Amazon Customer,"worst packaging, Packaged iphone in plastic bag and shipped from Hariyana to Gujarat
overall Product is good"
47,Gaurav,"Good things
1. Camera as always amazing ( cinematic vedio is wow).
2. Battery performance has improved tremendously
3. No lags
4. Size is good , good for watching movies.
5. Look is above average.

Not good
1. Charger not available ( whatever logic company gives , it should be available, one have a buy ) , people buying iPhone can buy the charger additionally but that doesn't mean they will be excluded ??"
48,Sachin sharma,Overall a good quality product and best service from Amazon really appreciate
49,Saikumar,13??
50,SIMONKISKOO,First time upgraded to iphone nd it's worth it.??
51,Dr (Maj) Vishal Sahai,"LITTLE DOUBTFUL EARLIER SINCE IT IS FOR THE FIRST TIME I HAVE PURCHASE ANYTHING OF THIS HEFTY AMOUNT OF MONEY THROUGH AMAZON , BUT NOW 100% SATISFIED, I THANK AMAZON AND APPLE FOR KEEPING THIS CONFIDENCE AND TRUST....GOT BEST DEAL THRU AMAZON - IN MARKET IT IS APPROX 7000/- COSTLIER....ALSO RECEIVED INVOICE BILL AND PACKING SLIP ALONG WITH IT. NOW JUST WANTED TO VISIT APPLE SERVICE CENTER FOR FURTHER REGISTRATION AND WARRANTY CONFIRMATION."
52,Anil Sharma,"tl;dr:
If you can spend more money and want a better camera go with Pro or ProMax
If you like the Apple EcoSystem you can get this else stick to Android

Pros :
1. Good Display / Brightness (Supports Dark mode and You can control White Tone which is nice). It has 60Hz refresh rate but you won't feel the difference imho
2. Good Battery Life (iPhone 13 Series has good battery life but ensure you have a supported charger) I use my MacBook's charger which charges the phone pretty quickly.
3. Best Privacy Control
4. Camera in Portrait Mode and Selfie Camera (LiveText Detection is a nice feature)
5. Fast Processor / RAM management is good
6. Great Resale value / Apple Support

Cons:

1. Screen size (6.1"" which is less in this price segment)
2. Optical Zoom in 13 is not great (If you want a camera phone go with Pro or Pro Max or Android alternative)
3. Third Party App Size is Huge (Gmail is 300MB / YouTube 250 MB). No native app lock option
4. Very Less OS customizations / No Fingerprint Scanner (hopeful this gets better with iOS 16)
5. No Native Support for mkv and other video formats (you can download a third party though)
6. Native iOS Apps either require a subscription or are paid.
7. File Management is restricted / Not easy to download *multiple* files from Telegram / Drive"
53,VIKRAM BIHARI,"It’s first time that I purchased iPhone 13.No doubt it’s costly but a better quality of smartphone this is.I received iPhone in good condition ordered on Amazon after one day.phone is very good to hold ,to talk and it is not hitting as I felt almost all of smartphones of VIVO,Realme etc under Rs.20000/-overall it’s a good phone and I can purchase according to ur pocket size."
54,aambuj,"Gets all smartphone fundamentals right, jack of all trades, master of performance and battery life. I have been a 4 year OnePlus flagship user, and I can say that there is absolutely no comparison. The software in iPhone works very well with the hardware. And it pairs up with my laptop like nothing I ever seen. I can copy on my phone and paste on my laptop and vice versa. I can pick up call on my laptop instead of phone while I am working. Can transfer files/images directly to my laptop from phone and vice versa without any loss in quality. I am still exploring the benefits but so far now, it has been incredible."
55,Divyani,"Have been using iPhone 11,
Upgrade Feels worth it skipping iPhone 12

Very snappy and responsive

Camera improvement is evident

Os is smooth as always

No complaints whatsoever

Perfect product"
56,FARDANI,Well except that the product delivered was manufactured way back in April and the box looked old from outside. I didn't find anything negative. The phone works normal till date. Amazing camera. Loved how it syncs automatically with the iPad and how they work together to make my life tad a bit easier.
